# Node.js

Online File Explorer App :
The landing page has different folders and files which are located in the directory chosen in the server. The page has name of the folder/file, it's size and the last modified date and the breadcrumb shows the relative path of the file. The browser will be able to read the file if it reads the extension of that particular file correctly. For rendering the data in terms of video, we use readable file streams. We can also read html files in the browser. We can re-order the elements depending on sorting order in terms of name, size of folders, and also last modified field. Built-in module like http is used to create the server and to accept user requests as well as respond to them. Https module is used to get the JSON data from an external link which uses https. Moreover, use of child_process,filesystem and path module is done.
